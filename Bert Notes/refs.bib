	abstract = {In this classic of statistical mathematical theory, Harald Cram r joins the two major lines of development in the field: while British and American statisticians were developing the science of statistical inference, French and Russian probabilitists transformed the classical calculus of probability into a rigorous and pure mathematical theory. The result of Cram r's work is a masterly exposition of the mathematical methods of modern statistics that set the standard that others have since sought to follow. For anyone with a working knowledge of undergraduate mathematics the book is self contained. The first part is an introduction to the fundamental concept of a distribution and of integration with respect to a distribution. The second part contains the general theory of random variables and probability distributions while the third is devoted to the theory of sampling, statistical estimation, and tests of significance.},

	abstract = {Let a random sample of size n be taken from a distribution having a density depending on a real parameter θ, and let θ have an absolutely continuous prior distribution with density π(θ). We give a rigorous proof that, under suitable regularity conditions, the posterior distribution of θ will, when n tends to infinity, be asymptotically normal with mean equal to the maximum-likelihood estimator and variance equal to the reciprocal of the second derivative of the logarithm of the likelihood function evaluated at the maximum-likelihood estimator, independently of the form of π(θ).},
